/*
	Q:

	Do you expect any of a fileâ€™s three timestamps to be changed by the stat() system
	call? If not, explain why.


	A:

	I expected it to maybe change last access time, but since it does not access the file itself,
	but data in the inode table instead, it leaves all timestamps intact as demonstrated in the program.

	What it DOES do though, is change the last access/modified time for the directory that it resides in.
