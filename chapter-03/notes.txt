ldd myprogram: lists dynamic dependencies of an executable




open('somefile.txt', O_RDWR | O_TRUNC, "w");

fd = open(pathname, flags, mode);
if (fd == -1) {
	/* Code to handle the error */
}



some system calls, you should set errno = 0 to error check, because some of these system calls can return a non-zero on success... like getpriority()


#include <stdio.h>
perror(const char *msg) prints an error message, AND another message based on value of errno



Promote system data types to long so there is no information loss.
printf("My PID is %ld\n", (long)mypid);
except off_t, those are %lld


%zd for size_t and ssize_t is to be avoided I guess, since it's not available accross the board. use %ld
